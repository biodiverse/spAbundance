`spAbundance` fits single-species and multi-species spatial abundance models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The package is in initial stages of development and testing of existing functionality is not complete so use of the package prior to it's first release on CRAN is at your own risk. `spAbundance` uses analogous syntax to its "sister package" [spOccupancy](https://www.jeffdoser.com/files/spoccupancy-web/) (Doser et al. 2022). 

## Installation

`spAbundance` is in the initial stages of active development. The functionality currently implemented is not yet stable, and should be used with caution. To download the development version of the package, you can use `devtools` as follows:  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("doserjef/spAbundance")
```

Note that because we implement the MCMC in C++, you will need a C++ compiler on your computer to install the package from GitHub, which may not work on certain machines. If you run into this problem and are interested in using the development version of the package, feel free to send me an email: doserjef@msu.edu.

## Functionality

Below is a running list of currently implemented functionality. This will be updated as new functionality is included

|`spAbundance` Function  | Description                                                     |
|---------------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|`NMix()`           | Single-species N-mixture model                                       |
|`spNMix()`         | Single-species spatial N-mixture model                               |
|`abund()`          | Single-species abundance GLM without imperfect detection             |
|`spAbund()`        | Single-species spatial abundance GLM without imperfect detection     |
|`msAbund()`        | Multi-species abundance GLM without imperfect detection              |
|`ppcAbund()`       | Posterior predictive check using Bayesian p-values                   | 
|`waicAbund()`      | Calculate Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC)             |
|`simNMix()`        | Simulate single-species repeated count data                          |
|`simAbund()`       | Simulate single-species count data without imperfect detection       |

All model fitting functions allow for Poisson and negative binomial distributions for the abundance portion of the model.
