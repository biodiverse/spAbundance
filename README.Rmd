`spAbundance` fits univariate (i.e., single-species) and multivariate (i.e., multi-species) spatial abundance models using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The package currently contains all functionality for it's first release on CRAN, and is currently undergoing extensive testing prior to the release on CRAN. `spAbundance` uses analogous syntax to its "sister package" [spOccupancy](https://www.jeffdoser.com/files/spoccupancy-web/) (Doser et al. 2022). 

## Installation

`spAbundance` is not yet on CRAN, with a planned initial submission date in Fall 2023. To download the development version of the package, you can use `devtools` as follows:  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("doserjef/spAbundance")
```

Note that because we implement the MCMC in C++, you will need a C++ compiler on your computer to install the package from GitHub. To compile C++ on Windows, you can install [`RTools`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). To compile C++ on a Mac, you can install `XCode` from the Mac app store.

All model fitting functions allow for Poisson and negative binomial distributions for the abundance portion of the model. All GLM(M)s also allow for Gaussian models.
